    answer:
      'Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project-wide rules that should shape every request, such as build commands and repository conventions. Use a file under `.github/instructions/` with an `applyTo` glob when guidance only matters for certain paths or file types.

    question:
      'Why use plan mode before asking Copilot to scaffold a feature that spans several files?',
    answer:
      'Plan mode separates deciding what to build from changing the code. Copilot can inspect the repository, ask clarifying questions, and propose an approach before edits begin, so misunderstandings are cheaper to correct. Direct execution is faster for small, well-scoped work; planning is safer when architecture, scope, or dependencies are still uncertain.',

      'Custom instructions provide always-on guidance for work in their scope. A custom agent is an optional specialist with its own context, tools, and role, which makes it better for focused delegated work such as a security review or accessibility audit.

      'Why is the `description` in a skill especially important?',
    answer:
      'Copilot uses the description to decide whether a skill is relevant to the current request and should be loaded. A vague description makes activation unreliable, while a precise description names the task and conditions that should trigger the skill. This on-demand loading keeps specialized guidance out of unrelated conversations.',

      'A local MCP server runs code on your machine and exposes tools that Copilot can call with your account permissions. A malicious or compromised server could read sensitive files or take unintended actions, so treat it like any executable dependency: verify its publisher and source, then enable only the tools needed for the task.

      "A dedicated worktree and branch isolate one session's edits from other sessions, allowing several agents to work in parallel without colliding.

    answer:

Because an MCP server runs separately and can receive session context or perform actions on your machine, an untrusted server creates a meaningful security boundary.

      'Why is Agent mode better suited than Ask mode for implementing a feature across several project files?',
    answer:
      'Ask mode answers a question or suggests an approach, but it does not continue through a multi-step implementation. Agent mode can determine which files need changes, edit across the project, run tools or commands, inspect failures, and refine the solution. That feedback loop is what makes it appropriate for a feature whose UI, service, routing, and tests must stay coordinated.',

    question:
      'Why can analyzing an exception from the Visual Studio debugger produce a more specific answer than describing it in a new chat?',
    answer:
      'The debugger can supply Copilot with the current call stack, code location, exception, and live variable values automatically. That runtime context lets Copilot reason about the execution state that actually failed instead of relying only on a written description. The same advantage applies when asking about a value from a watch window or data tip.',

      'Why can enabling fewer MCP toolsets improve both response quality and security?',
    answer:
      'Every enabled tool must be described in the model context, leaving less room for your code and conversation. A smaller toolset also makes it easier for Copilot to select the right capability and reduces the actions available if a prompt or server behaves unexpectedly. Enable the servers and tools relevant to the current task, then disable the rest.',

    question:
      'When should a team create a prompt file instead of adding more content to `copilot-instructions.md`?',
    answer:
      '`copilot-instructions.md` should contain durable project guidance that applies to every request. Prompt files are invoked on demand, can target a particular mode, and can accept inputs, making them better for repeatable workflows such as generating tests or scaffolding an endpoint. Keeping task-specific procedures in prompt files prevents the always-on instructions from becoming noisy.',

      'How does delegating to the cloud differ from using local Agent mode, and why does the initial prompt need more context?',
    answer:
      'Local Agent mode works synchronously against your current development environment, while the cloud agent runs asynchronously in an isolated environment from the repository state and returns its work through a pull request. It cannot see local uncommitted changes or depend on a live back-and-forth while it works. Include the goal, constraints, relevant paths, and acceptance criteria up front so the remote task can proceed independently.',
